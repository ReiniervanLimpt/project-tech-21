# FoodLove
Foodlove brings foodies together, users specify their sexual orientation and their favourite food / table to eat at.
Food lovers who enjoy to eat at restaurants are paired together to go on a romantic dinner at a restaurant serving their prefered cuisine, users who are okay with eating at someone elses place are paired with users who love cooking in the comfort of their own home!

To better specify the needs of my users i have written a couple of job stories to then look for functionalities which support those needs.

## my functionality
Ive decided i want to focus on the registration and logging in of users because i think there is some fun things i can do with AJAX to improve the user experience and give feedback instead of keeping the user in the dark when something goes wrong (ive also included some safety measuers with argon2 hashing).
