# FoodLove
Foodlove brings foodies together, users specify their sexual orientation and their favourite food / table to eat at.
Food lovers who enjoy to eat at restaurants are paired together to go on a romantic dinner at a restaurant serving their prefered cuisine, users who are okay with eating at someone elses place are paired with users who love cooking in the comfort of their own home!

To better specify the needs of my users i have written a couple of job stories to then look for functionalities which support those needs.
